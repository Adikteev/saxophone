Saxophone is inspired by SAX parsers like
[sax-js](https://github.com/isaacs/sax-js) and
[easysax](https://github.com/vflash/easysax): it does not generate any
DOM while parsing documents. Instead, it reports parsing events
for each tag or text node encountered. This means that Saxophone
has a really low memory footprint.

The parser does not keep track of the document state while parsing
and does not check whether the document is well-formed or valid,
making it super-fast (see [benchmarks](#benchmarks) below).

This library is best suited when you need to extract simple data
out of an XML document that you know is well-formed. The parser will
not report precise errors in case of syntax problems. An example would
be reading data from an API endpoint.

## Installation

This library works both in Node.JS â‰¥4.0 and recent browsers.
To install with `npm`:

```sh
$ npm install --save saxophone
```

## Benchmarks

| Library            | Operations per second (higher is better) |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------:|
| **Saxophone**      | **1,099 ops/sec Â±2.16%**                 |
| **EasySax**        | **1,033 ops/sec Â±2.52%**                 |
| node-expat         | 360 ops/sec Â±3.76%                       |
| libxmljs.SaxParser | 236 ops/sec Â±3.94%                       |
| sax-js             | 113 ops/sec Â±3.87%                       |

To run the benchmarks by yourself, use the following commands:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/matteodelabre/saxophone.git
$ cd saxophone
$ npm install
$ npm install easysax node-expat libxmljs sax
$ npm run benchmark
```

## Tests and coverage

To run tests and check coverage, use the following commands:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/matteodelabre/saxophone.git
$ cd saxophone
$ npm install
$ npm test
$ npm run coverage
```

## Usage

### Example

```js
const Saxophone = require('saxophone');
const parser = Saxophone();

// called whenever an opening tag is found in the document,
// such as <example id="1" /> - see below for a list of events
parser.on('tagopen', tag => {
    console.log(
        `Open tag "${tag.name}" with attributes: ${JSON.stringify(Saxophone.parseAttrs(tag.attrs))}.`
    );
});

// called when parsing the document is done
parser.on('end', () => {
    console.log('Parsing finished.');
});

// triggers parsing - remember to set up listeners before
// calling this method
parser.parse('<root><example id="1" /><example id="2" /></root>');
```

Output:

```sh
Open tag "root" with attributes: {}.
Open tag "example" with attributes: {"id":"1"}.
Open tag "example" with attributes: {"id":"2"}.
Parsing finished.
```

### API

#### `Saxophone()`

Returns a new Saxophone instance. This is a factory method,
so you **must not prefix it with the `new` keyword.**

#### `Saxophone#on()`, `Saxophone#removeListener()`, ...

Saxophone composes with the EventEmitter methods. To work
with listeners, check out [Node's documentation.](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html)

#### `Saxophone#parse(xml)`

Triggers the actual parsing. This method will fire registered listeners
so you need to set them up before calling it.

`xml` is a string containing the XML that you want to parse. At this
time, Saxophone does not support `Buffer`s or `Stream`s.

#### `Saxophone.parseAttrs(attrs)`

Parses a string list of XML attributes, as produced by the main parsing
algorithm. This is not done automatically because it may not be required
for every tag and it takes some time.

The result is an object associating the attribute names (as object keys)
to their attribute values (as object values).

### Events

#### `tagopen`

Emitted when an opening tag is parsed. This encompasses
both regular tags and self-closing tags. An object is passed
with the following data.

* `name`: name of the parsed tag.
* `attrs`: attributes of the tag (as a string). To parse this string, use `Saxophone.parseAttrs`.
* `isSelfClosing`: true if the tag is self-closing.

#### `tagclose`

Emitted when a closing tag is parsed. An object containing the
`name` of the tag is passed.

#### `error`

Emitted when a parsing error is encountered while reading the
XML stream such that the rest of the XML cannot be correctly
interpreted.

Because this library's goal is not to provide accurate error
reports, the passed error will only contain a short description
of the syntax error (without giving the position, for example).

#### `text`

Emitted when a text node between two tags is parsed.
An object with the `contents` of the text node is passed.
You might need to expand XML entities inside the contents of
the text node, using `Saxophone.parseEntities`.

#### `end`

Emitted after all events, without arguments.
